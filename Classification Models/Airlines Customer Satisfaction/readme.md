# Airlines Customer Satisfaction Classification
In this modernn era of competition and consumerism, it is vital for any company to stay ahead of it's competitors by keeping it's customers satisfied and loyal. This Data is taken from Kaggle and it consists of a survey done by an airline on it's flight passengers to determine what are the factors that make a customer satisfied with the services.

## Getting Started
My objective for this analysis was to use as much data as possible by minimizing the discard of data. This needed a fairly good amount of brainstorming and patience to understand the data.
But all of those stressful hours paid off when my models performed better than most of the people who have solved this data set on Kaggle.
